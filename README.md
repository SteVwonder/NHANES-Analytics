# NHANES-Analytics
This repository contains code related to NHANES dietary data analysis for
creating nutrient-driven food groups, as documented in:

M. Wyatt, T. Johnston, M. Papas, and M. Taufer.  Development of a Scalable
Method for Creating Food Groups Using the NHANES Dataset and MapReduce.  In
*Proceedings of the ACM Bioinformatics and Computational Biology Conference
(BCB)*, pp. 1 – 10. Seattle, WA, USA. October 2 – 4, 2016.

# Requirements
* Python 2
* Apache Spark / Pyspark
* numpy
* scipy

# Contents
The analysis is split into 2 parts:

_Preprocessing_
`./src/preprocess.py` contains the PySpark script for preprocessing the
NHANES dietary data

_Clustering_
`./src/cluster.py` contains the PySpark script for clustering the preprocessed
data

# Usage
To run the code, you will need Apache Spark installed.  You can run the code
with the bash script located at `./src/run.sh`.  This will create several new
files and directories in the `./data/` directory.

The data is saved with the spark command `saveAsPickleFile` and can be loaded
with the spark command `pickleFile`.  For example, to load the processed data
into a `pyspark` session, do: `sc.pickleFile("./data/processed")`.

# Data
1 Year of NHANES data is in `./data/raw`.  This data and more years of NHANES
data can be downloaded from
https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/tutorials/nhanes/Preparing/Download/intro.htm

The file `./data/features.txt` contains a list of features which are to be
extracted from the NHANES dietary data.

Additionally, a script to download all NHANES data is included at
`./src/get_data.py`.  To run this, uncomment line 7 from `./src/run.sh`.  Or
visit the main (and most up-to-date) repo for this script at
